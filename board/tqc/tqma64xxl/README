# TQ-Systems TQMa64XxL

The TQ-Systems TQMa64XxL is a System-on-Module based on the TI AM64 SoC family.

## Module variants

The TQMa64xxL currently only exists in one variant with 1GiB LPDDR4 RAM.

## Base boards / configurations

The following combinations of base board and module are supported:

* TQ-Systems MBaX4XxL with TQMa64XxL
  - tqma64xxl_mbax4xxl_r5_defconfig
  - tqma64xxl_mbax4xxl_a53_defconfig

As described in the following section, bootloaders for both the R5 and A53
cores of the AM64x must be built.

## Boot sequence

The bootloader on the AM64 is loaded in multiple stages. 3 of these stages
are provided by this U-Boot repository:

* R5 U-Boot SPL (combined with SYSFW to `tiboot3.bin`; see next section)
* A53 U-Boot SPL (`tispl.bin`)
* A53 U-Boot (`u-boot.img`)

The R5 bootloader performs the following actions:

* Initialize DDR controller
* Load `tispl.bin` (which contains ATF, OP-TEE and the A53 SPL) into DDR RAM
* Boot ATF

The A53 SPL and full U-Boot are both built from the `a53` defconfigs. The build
requires an ARM-v8/AArch64 cross compiler. `bl31.bin` (ATF) and
`bl32.bin` (OP-TEE) must be provided in the root of the U-Boot build directory
to produce a working bootloader.

The next stage is handled by the ATF: It will start the OP-TEE and the A53 SPL,
which have already been loaded by the R5 bootloader. The A53 SPL then loads and
starts the full A53 U-Boot from `u-boot.img`.

Finally, the full A53 U-Boot runs, which can provide a command line interface
and boot into the actual OS depending on its configuration.

## R5 boot image build

The R5 bootloader is built from the `r5` defconfigs and it requires an ARM-v7
cross compiler (32bit). Only the SPL component of this build is used.

While this defconfig produces a file called `tiboot3.bin`, this file is
incomplete, as it does not contain a system controller firmware (SYSFW). A tool
that performs this step can be found at:

  https://git.ti.com/cgit/k3-image-gen/k3-image-gen/

To produce the combined `tiboot3.bin`, run the following command in
the k3-image-gen repository:

```
make CROSS_COMPILE=... SOC=am64x CONFIG=evm SBL=.../spl/u-boot-spl.bin
```

## DIP Settings for MMC/SPI-NOR boot

On eMMC/SD card a FAT boot partition is used for the SYSFW and U-Boot.
On SPI-NOR, separate MTD partitions are defined for the individual stages.

Notes:

* See RM spruim2c.pdf, ch. 4.3.1 BOOTMODE Pin Mapping
* S4/S5 are used for primary boot device selection
* S5/S6 are used for primary boot device configuration
* S6/S7 are used for backup boot device selection and configuration
* Only primary boot devices are considered below
* `X`: Position of DIP
* `-`: Don't care

Note: This configuration uses the MMCSD mode with port 0 to boot a full
filesystem image from the eMMC user partition, which is not officially supported
by TI for the AM64x. Refer to the SoC documentation provided by TI for
information on the use of the eMMC boot partitions.
